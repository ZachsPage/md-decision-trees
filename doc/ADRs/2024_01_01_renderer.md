# Render ADR

## Context
When looking into passing the serialized graph over to the UI, it quickly became apparent that the layout logic will
get too complicated. For example, it's easy if each node has up to two child nodes - but spacing becomes an issue when
dealing with one node having many more children (adjusting each child & parent propagates sideways & upward). Alike,
node placement when it has multiple parent nodes is an issue.

## Decision - How to deal with complicated graph layouts? 
To deal with graph layouts, this project should use an established project to avoid reinventing the wheel - poorly.
[Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/#introduction) seems to meet this projects needs:
* Is MIT license, is widely used, good documentation / API examples, many types of layouts

## Other Considerations
Alternatives:
* [mxGraph](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph) - seems more bare-bones, but does export images (nvm, cytoscape does too)
* [d3](https://d3js.org/) - seems to be more for more general data visualization, while cytoscape is for graphs

Outcomes:
* Pro - will help a lot when dealing with graph layouts
* Cons - learning curve for new APIs, have some rework / refactors (showing rectangles, interactions, lines)
* Conclusion - would otherwise be unable to handle all edge cases so moving forward with the integration is best
